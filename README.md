Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is the systematic application of enginnering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintainance of high-quality software systems.involves design, testingdeployment and mainatinance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming languageslike C, Fotrain,
establishment of software enginnering as a descpline in 1960's,
advent of structural programming in 1970's,
and rise of agile methodologies in 2000's

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- involves gathering and documenting user needs and systems requirements.
Design- coming up with high-level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
Implementation-writing code and building softwares according to specifications.
Testing-Conducting various tests to ensure software meets standards and functional requirements.
Deployment-releasing the software to the users.
Maintainance-providing on-going support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies - involves sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
while Agile methodologies- Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Agile methodology is used in scenarios where requirements changes regulalry and hence continous improvements.
Waterfall- used when the development follows sequence of events. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- oversees planning, execution, and qualit of software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- are Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code .
Version Control Systems(VCS) - Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.
IDEs-Visual Studio Code, Eclipse
Version Controls  Systems-Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements
Tight deadlines
Technical debt
Strategies- Effective communication, agile mthodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and objectives

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing-Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
Acceptance testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance:
measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process,
leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt enginnering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
importance:
Helps us solve problems which are repetitive in nature,
saves time.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- "Tell me about dogs"
improved- "Tell me about Germany Sherphads dogs"
this shows a consice specific prompt about which type of dog you want AI to tell you about.
